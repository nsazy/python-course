My name is Nick Sazy.  I am a Pediatric Nurse with a background in Healthcare IT.  I have Masters Degrees in both Nursing and Software Development.

This is a beginning programming course developed for healthcare professionals looking to learn the basics of how to program using the Python programming language as well as the basics of learning how to use a database.  Even though this course was developed for healthcare professionals, anyone with no programming experience can benefit from it.  

The lectures should be followed in succession from from Lecture 1 (Variables) through to Lecture 10 (Databases Part II) since each lecture builds on the previous.  Even though the course was developed for healthcare profressionals due to references to made to healthcare during the series, anyone with no programming experience can benefit from it.  This is a beginner level programming course developed for anyone with no programming experience.
